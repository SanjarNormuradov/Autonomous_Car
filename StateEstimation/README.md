# Localization
The key goal of this assignment was to get under various conditions an understanding of the properties of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Particle
Filter (PF) with a landmark-based sensor model, learned from camera images, and an odometry-based motion model.

***The code for this assignment is NOT provided due to the course policy, but could be demonstrated on demand***

The following sections show the results of the implementations for various parameters and discuss some interesting observations.
## EKF

## PF
